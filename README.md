Monitoring for the rest of us

Very much a work-in-progress, this will be a simple web based monitoring system -or sa they call it nowadays, observabilbity platform.
Goals are that it is quick to install, quick to configure, and quick to run.
It will produce both alerts and reports.
It will use a templating system for customising views
